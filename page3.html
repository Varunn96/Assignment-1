            <h2> Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid </h2>
            <p> The internal combustion side of things is courtesy of 
                 2.9L direct-injection twin-turbo V6. This provides the 
                 Panamera 4 E-Hybrid with 330hp and 450Nm. Between the 
                 engine and an eight-speed version of dual-clutch gearbox 
                 (Porsche Doppelkupplung, or PDK) is an electric motor rated at 
                 136hp and 400NM. It's worth noting that the total power and 
                 torque output for the powertrain is a little less than the 
                 sum of its parts, but 462hp and 700Nm is still more than adequate 
                 for a vehicle with a curb weight of 2,190kg. 
            </p>
            <h2> Lexus LC500 Hybrid </h2>
            <p> This wild aerodynamic machine comes with a gas-electric drivetrain 
                using an Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V-6 and two electric motors.
                It combines the V-6 with a pair of electric motors through 
                a fascinating transmission that’s essentially two gearboxes 
                in one. It incorporates both a two-motor hybrid continuously 
                variable transmission (CVT) and an Aisin four-speed automatic 
                to broaden the hybrid operating range. The hybrid setup increases the kerb weight 
                which hampers the LC500h’s acceleration, compared to the normal LC500.
            </p>
            <h2> Hyundia Ionic Hybrid</h2>
            <p> Under IONIQ Hybrid's hood two hearts beat as one: a 32kW electric 
                motor and a Kappa 1.6-litre Atkinson cycle GDi engine. It switches 
                seamlessly between the conventional engine and electric motor. 
                Gasoline direct injection extracts the maximum amount of energy from 
                each droplet of fuel while delivering a combined system output of 
                104kW. With a drag coefficient (Cd) of just 0.24, the IONIQ Hybrid 
                blends stunning design and superlative aerodynamic performance.
            </p>
            <h2> BMW i8 </h2>
            <p> 
                The plug-in hybrid system of the BMW i8 comprises of a 
                three-cylinder, 1.5-liter BMW TwinPower turbo gasoline 
                engine combined with BMW eDrive technology used in the 
                BMW i3 and develops maximum power of 230 hp. The BMW i8's 
                second power source is a hybrid synchronous electric motor 
                specially developed and produced by the BMW Group for BMW i. 
                The electric motor develops maximum power of 131 hp 
                and produces its maximum torque of around 320 N⋅m
                from standstill. Typical of an electric motor, responsive power
                is instantly available when starting and this continues into 
                the higher load ranges. It can accelerate from a dead-stop
                to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds and has an electronic limited top speed of 250 km/h.
            </p>
            <h2> Ferrari Laferrari </h2>
            <p>
                The LaFerrari is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Ferrari. 
                LaFerrari literally means "The Ferrari" in Italian , in this context in 
                the sense that it is the "definitive" Ferrari. Only 499 units 
                have been built, and each cost more than 1 million US dollars. The LaFerrari
                is the first mild hybrid from Ferrari, providing the highest power output of
                any Ferrari. LaFerrari's internal combustion engine is a mid-rear mounted 
                Ferrari F140 65° V12 with a 6.3-litre (6262 cc) capacity producing 789 bhp @ 9000 rpm and 700 N⋅m of torque @ 6,750 rpm,
                supplemented by a 161 bhp KERS unit,
                which will provide short bursts of extra power.
            </p>
            <h2> McLaren P1 </h2>
            <p>
                McLaren’s 903bhp hybrid hypercar that promises to be the most involving
                car to drive on road and track. The heart is a 3.8-litre V8 biturbo, producing 727bhp. 
                The electric bit pushes out 176bhp, and handily fills in the torque hole 
                left by turbo lag. It is rear wheel driven via McLaren’s 
                seven-speed twin-clutch, giving 0-62mph in 2.8secs. Power for the electric motor is
                 stored in a 324-cell lithium-ion high-density battery pack. The battery can be 
                 charged by the engine or through a plug-in equipment. The car can be operated using either the petrol engine, the 
                 electric motor or with a combination of the two.
            </p>
            <h2> Porsche 918 </h2>
            <p>
                The Porsche 918 is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by
                German automobile manufacturer Porsche. It is powered by a naturally 
                aspirated 4.6-litre V8 engine, developing 608 bhp, with two electric
                motors delivering an additional 279 bhp for a combined output of 887 bhp. 
                The energy storage system is a 312-cell, 
                liquid-cooled 6.8 kW·h lithium-ion battery positioned behind the passenger
                cell, which delivers an
                all-electric range of 19 km. The batteries are also charged by regenerative braking and by excess output 
                from the engine when the car is coasting.
