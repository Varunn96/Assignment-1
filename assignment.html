                <h2> <em>The Ferrari Laferrari</em> </h2>
                <p> The <strong>LaFerrari</strong> is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Ferrari. 
                    LaFerrari literally means "The Ferrari" in Italian , in this context in 
                    the sense that it is the "definitive" Ferrari. On 3 December 2016, a LaFerrari
                     was auctioned off for $7 million (£5,743,500.00) making this car "the most
                      valuable 21st century automobile ever sold at auction". Only 499 units 
                      have been built, and each cost more than 1 million US dollars. The LaFerrari
                       is the first mild hybrid from Ferrari, providing the highest power output of
                        any Ferrari.</p>

                <h2> <em>The Mclaren P1</em> </h2>
                <p> <strong>McLaren</strong>’s £866,000, 903bhp hybrid hypercar that promises to be the most involving
                     car to drive on road and track. The heart is the familiar 3.8-litre V8 biturbo 
                     that sees duty in the 12C and 650S, but with bigger turbos to produce 727bhp and
                      531lb ft. The electric bit pushes out 176bhp and 192lb ft (twice the KERS system
                       on a 2013 F1 car), and handily fills in the torque hole left by turbo lag. It
                        all drives exclusively to the rear wheels via McLaren’s seven-speed twin-clutch,
                         giving 0-62mph in 2.8secs and a quarter mile in 9.8secs @ 152mph. </p>

                <h2> <em>The Porsche 918</em> </h2>
                <p> The <strong>Porsche 918</strong> is a mid-engined plug-in hybrid sports car manufactured by
                     German automobile manufacturer Porsche. The Spyder is powered by a naturally 
                     aspirated 4.6-litre V8 engine, developing 616 PS (608 bhp; 453 kW), with two electric
                      motors delivering an additional 283 PS (279 bhp; 208 kW) for a combined output of 899
                       PS (887 bhp; 661 kW). The 918 Spyder's 6.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an
                    all-electric range of 19 km (12 mi) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's 
                    five-cycle tests.</p>
